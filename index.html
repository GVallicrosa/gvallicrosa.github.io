 <h1>About</h1>

  <h2>Research and Learning</h2>

  <p>Currently I am a Postdoctoral researcher at the
    <a href="http://cirs.udg.edu/">Underwater Robotics Research Center (CIRS)</a>,
    part of the
    <a href="http://vicorob.udg.edu/">Computer Vision and Robotics Institute (VICOROB)</a>,
    working mainly on the <a href="https://www.eumarinerobots.eu/">EUMarineRobots</a> project.
  </p>

  <p>
    I obtained the Bachelor with honors in <strong>Industrial Engineering</strong> on 2011 at
    <a href="http://www.udg.edu/">Universitat de Girona (UdG)</a>.
    Then I took the
    <a href="http://www.vibot.org">Erasmus Mundus Master in Computer Vision and Robotics (VIBOT)</a>
    at University of Burgundy, Universitat de Girona and Heriot-Watt University. One semester on each of the universities and a semester for the Master Thesis.
  </p>

 <p>I been interested about research since I was little. At second year of Industrial Engineering Bachelor I joined the
    <a href="http://grep.udg.edu">Product, Process and Production Engineering Research Group (GREP)</a>
    working first on lathe and EDM processes, and later on 3D printing processes with
    a Fab@Home and a RepRap printers. During this stage I participated in the national
  project IBE-RM and the European project IREBID.
  </p>

 <p>On the summer between the two-year master, I moved to the
    <a href="http://cirs.udg.edu">Underwater Robotics Research Center (CIRS)</a>,
    contracted for the European project TRIDENT. Then I returned on the last semester for the Master Thesis and stayed
    as a PhD student, participating actively in many of the national (3DAUV, ARCHROV, COMAROB) and european projects (MORPH, EUROFLEETS2, LOON-DOCK, EXCELLABUST, STRONGMAR, EUMR) of the lab.
  </p>

  <p>
    On September 2014 I was chosen team leader for the Universitat de Girona team in the underwater robots competition
    <a href="http://www.eurathlon.eu/">Eurathlon</a>.
    The competition took place in La Spezia (Italy) in the installations of the CMRE.
    After five days of competition in various tasks like long range navigation, wall following,
    structure inspection, manipulation and mapping, the Girona team was proclaimed winner of the
    competition having achieved four first places and one second place on the five proposed tasks with the Sparus II AUV.
  </p>

  <p>
    On September 2015 I took the opportunity to move to Sydney for a research stay of 3 months. I went to the
    <a href="http://marine.acfr.usyd.edu.au/">Marine Robotics</a> group of the
    <a href="http://www.acfr.usyd.edu.au/">Australian Centre for Field Robotics (ACFR)</a> at the
    <a href="http://sydney.edu.au/">University of Sydney</a> under the supervision of professor Stefan B. Williams. I also had the opportunity to participate in a sea mapping campaign at the Great Barrier of Reef with SIRIUS AUV and IVER AUV.
  </p>

  <p>
    On November 2018 I obtained my PhD in Technology from Universitat de Girona with the thesis titled
    <a href="http://hdl.handle.net/10803/664427">Online Acoustic Localization Methods for Autonomous Underwater Vehicles</a>.
    Where a range-only localization method is used to correctly localize a docking station, 
    and a Hilbert Map continuous occupancy representation is used to build a SLAM method that provides maps
    usable for online path-planning.

  <h2>Hobbies</h2>

  <p>
    I love nature and many cultural traditions. I try to go hiking as often as possible and at least once a year on a long route through the Pyrenees. I have been involved in many non-profit organizations as a volunteer. The first one was in the Esplai el Pas (scouts) since I was little and then continuing leading other children. Regarding tradition, I joined two groups of Diables (RatpenatsInfernals and DiablesFolls), that prepare celebrations with fire and fireworks on the streets. Also joined the Xoriguers de la UdG human towers group when I started Bachelor at UdG. I also joined and helped during the first years of the Castellers de l'Alt Maresme, another human towers group near my hometown.
